```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is a section header of my document

In this first code chunck we see both cammands and the output:

```{r, echo = T}
#my own code chunk
1 + 1
```

For the second code chunck, I want to show only the output:
```{r, echo = F}
2 + 5
```
