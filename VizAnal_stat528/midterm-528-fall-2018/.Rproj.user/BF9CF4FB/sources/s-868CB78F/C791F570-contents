Since 1972 the General Social Survey (GSS) is conducted every two years by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC).
The survey allows insight into developing trends across dozens of different topics. 

From the GSS [website](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/variables/):

> The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

Here we are focusing on some of these aspects. A file with the data is part of the folder you downloaded. You can get ready for answering the questions below by running the following lines of code:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
gss <- readRDS("gss.rds")
```

0. Include your name in the YAML at the top of this file. Include your responses to the questions (code and comments) in this file and submit in Canvas. 

1.  (18 points) Each row of the `gss` data set corresponds to an interview. How many interviews were conducted each year? In which year were the most interviews conducted (and how many)? Draw a plot of the number of interviews by year. Describe the relationship in two to three sentences.

```{r}
# Your code goes here
```

2. (16 points) The variable `DEGREE` shows the respondent's highest educational degree.
Give a frequency breakdown of `DEGREE`. Change `DK` and `IAP` to NA.  
Bring the levels into an order reflecting the amount of schooling (i.e the new ordering should be `LT HIGH SCHOOL`, `HIGH SCHOOL`, `JUNIOR COLLEGE`, `BACHELOR`, `GRADUATE`). 
Draw side -by-side boxplots of age (`AGE`) by degree (`DEGREE`).  Comment on the result. 

```{r}
# Your code goes here
```

3. The variable `AGEKDBRN` is the respondents' age at the time their first kid was born. 

    a. (14 points) How many missing values are in the variable overall? Calculate the average and standard deviation of `AGEKDBRN` for men and women. Comment on it. 
    b. (26 points) Calculate the average of `AGEKDBRN` over time (`YEAR`), genders (`SEX`) and education (`DEGREE`). Make sure to keep track of how many values each average is based on. Plot the relationship for averages that are based on at least 30 records. Summarise the results in at least three sentences.

```{r}
# Your code goes here
```

4. The variable `REGION` contains the geographic region a respondent lives in. The file `division.csv` consists of a map of the United States with states grouped by their division. 

    a. (12 points) Load the file `division.csv` into the session and draw a map (using  `ggplot2`).
    b. (10 points) Describe what steps are necessary to create a choropleth map of the average age (`AGEKDBRN`) when the first kid is born in 2016 by region (`REGION`). Point out potential problems, but do not actually create the map!

```{r}
# Your code goes here
```
