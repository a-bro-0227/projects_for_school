These are some school projects I've completed throughout my college career.

I received my undergraduate degree in Economics and Supply Chain Management from the University of Northern Iowa.

I also have a master's degree in Business Analytics from the University of Iowa.

I consider myself a lifelong learner and frequently engage in random classes and tutorials, which you might find here.

While most of it may be out of context, but can provide a glimpse of what I studied.
